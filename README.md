A flying drone with only two spinning Motors and one of them turns clockwise and the other not clockwise.
The motors get tilted with two servos. By using a DSMX receiver you can control the drone. 
The processor that is used is a Arduino nano with MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope.

This project is not perfect. Sadly the code does not work very well.
